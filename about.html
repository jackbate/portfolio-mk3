                        <p>
                            Throughout my second year of sixth form and have an interest in various types of engineering and technology. 
                            I was first enticed into a career as a bio-mechanical engineer whilst researching specific sectors within the
                            engineering field, but quickly became intrigued with the designs of different products and more specifically the workings behind them, this expanded my overall interest within these general sectors.

                    <div class="about-2 about-box">
                        <p>
                            Throughout this time I developed a great interest of the programs that I was using during my engineering course and as a whole found a vast fascination with the workings of the programs.
                            I have recently been working part time while doing my course with netmatters <br>(SCS Scheme) full time in the hope that I can develop into a field I  have grown to really find a passion for.
                            I believe myself to be a very hard working and dedicated person, I can pick up most new skills relatively quickly and can adapt to various situations. I am a confident person and happy to engage in conversation with people of all ages.
